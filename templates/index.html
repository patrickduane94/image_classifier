<p>
This image classifier is trained to recognize feline and canine species.
    Uploaded images are categorized as cat, dog, or wild â€” where cat and dog refer to typical domestic pets, and wild refers to non-domesticated feline or canine species like lions or wolves.
For best results, use close-up images that show the animal's face clearly. Images of other species or poor quality photos cannot be accurately categorized.
