Image Classifier: Wild vs. Domesticated Cats and Dogs

This project is a web-based image classifier powered by a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained to distinguish between wild and domesticated species of cats and dogs based on facial images. Users can upload an image, and the application will return a prediction along with class probabilities after running the image through the trained CNN. Images are classified as cat, dog, or wild - cat and dog referring to the common pets, and wild referring to an undomesticated species of cat or dog such as a lion or wolf.
